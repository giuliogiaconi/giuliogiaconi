This was the presentation for my team's hackathon project. In our project, POLAR - Portraying OnLine hARm, we portrayed negativity on Twitter by building a dashboard to illustrate trends of tweet sentiments about 4 themes: LGBTQ+, Politics, Immigration and Environment in 2015/2016 and 2019/2020 - our dashboard can be found [here](https://project-polar.herokuapp.com/) and our code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/pcarugno/hackhate_polar)
